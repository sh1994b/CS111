The tarball includes:
	lab1b-server.c : source code for server
	lab1b-client.c : source code for client
	Makefile
	my.key : the key file used for encrypt option
	README 

I used the Sockets Tutorial provided on the project specifications
page to learn how to open, use, and close sockets.
I also used the tutorial for encryption provided by libmcrypt-dev source.
Other than that the only place where I got help was manual pages (to learn
different API's).
I did have a few problems that other students also had and they helped me
with it; those problems were:
	-how to stop the client from going through the while(1) loop
	indefinitely after receiving ^D from keyboard
		-->answer: checking whether length of input received from 
		the socket is 0 and if it is, terminating
	-how to deal with sanity error 124 (not detecting unwritable log file)
		-->answer: make sure to deal with opening the log file before
		setting the new terminal attributes
