Included files are:
	lab1a.c : source code for lab1a
	Makefile : Makefile for this lab
	README : the current file

I used the manual pages provided for different functions such as 
poll, waitpid, fork, etc. and the examples provided in them to get 
an idea of how to work with them. 
I was specifically having difficulty with fork() and poll() and 
watching a couple of videos on YouTube helped understand their 
functionality well.
