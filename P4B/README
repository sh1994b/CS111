This is the code for a program that can be executed with a BeagleBone Green
While running, the program outputs 1-second-apart timestamps along with the
temperature recorded by the BeagleBone sensor at that time to the log file
and to standard output.
Upon pressing the physical button connected to the BeagleBone the program exits
and logs "SHUTDOWN".
Commands can be entered during the execution:
  "SCALE=F" changes the scale of temperatures to Farenheit
  "SCALE=C" changes the scale of temperature readings to Celsius 
  "STOP" pauses the printing
  "START" starts the printing
  "PERIOD= " changes the time period between timestamps to specified value
  "OFF" does the same thing as pressing the button
